# touch-dnd-remapped
This is a direct clone of [touch-dnd-custom-events](https://www.npmjs.com/package/touch-dnd-custom-events) to address the following:

- Preview/ghost image was not rendering appropriately
- Remaps to standard DnD events rather than custom ones to limit the number of listeners needed
